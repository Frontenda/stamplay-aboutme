stamplay-aboutme
===================

**This project is built on the [Stamplay](https://stamplay.com) platform and [BackboneJS](http://backbonejs.org) to show how to build your own [About.me](http://about.me) in super short time.**

You can test it anytime simply creating a new project on Stamplay and uploading all the frontend assets with our client or our browser based code editor. 

Feel free to implement more cool features (see the last paragraph for ideas), contribute to this repo or clone it to use it by your own scopes. For any question drop an email to [giuliano.iacobelli@stamplay.com](mailto:giuliano.iacobelli@stamplay.com)

-----------------------
## About.me clone

This is a demo of what you can achieve with [Stamplay](http://stamplay.com).

It's somewhat of a clone of Hacker News. [View demo](https://68a5fe.stamplay.com/)

Currently, in order to show how to leverage Stamplay APIs and keep it simple we used [BackboneJS](http://backbonejs.org) to implement the client side logic. The clone with let our users to:

* Login with Facebook
* Configure the personal page
* Compliment pages of other users
* Let visitors of connect with the owner of the about.me page via email

Best of all, we used BackboneJS and Grunt to compile the assets to be compliant to the actual Stamplay apps' skeleton. Prepare to be amazed.

# Anatomy

HNclone is built around the following apis (components) of Stamplay

* [Users](http://docs.stamplay.apiary.io/#user)
* [Form](http://docs.stamplay.apiary.io/#form)
* [Custom Objects](http://docs.stamplay.apiary.io/#customobject)
* [Email](http://docs.stamplay.apiary.io/#email)


## Requirements

Go to [your account](http://editor.stamplay.com/apps) and create a new app.

Other required services :

* A [Facebook App](http://developers.facebook.com/apps) to setup Facebook Login auth


## Configuring the components

After creating a new app on [Stamplay](https://editor.stamplay.com) let's start by picking the component we want to use in our app that are: **User**, **Email**, **Custom Objects** and **Form**.

Lets see one-by-one how they are configured:

### User
the app leverages Facebook Login to provide an easy login to its users. In order to activate yours you need to get an APPID and APPSecret on [Facebook Developer's portal](http://developers.facebook.com/apps), create an app and add Stamplay.com as authorized domain as you can see in the pic below. 

![Facebook app settings](http://blog.stamplay.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Schermata-2014-07-22-alle-17.43.24.png "Facebook app settings")

now you have the data to configure Facebook Login on your app's user module. Go back on Stamplay, select the user component, add Facebook as signup service and then cut and paste the App ID and App Secret and click save.


# todo be finished


-----------------------
# Cloning

First, clone this repository :

    git clone git@github.com:Stamplay/stamplay-aboutme.git
    
Or download it as a zip file
	
	https://github.com/Stamplay/stamplay-aboutme/archive/master.zip 

Then you need to upload the frontend files in your app and you can do it in two ways:

* Copy/Upload them via the Layout section of your app on Stamplay editor
* [Get](http://cdn.stamplay.com/stamplay-sync/stamplay-sync.zip) and run **Stamplay Sync**, make it download the frontend assets of your app and then replace them with the ones you got from this repo. Stamplay Sync will upload everything for you on your app.


-----------------------
# Next steps

Here are a few ideas for further improvement :

* Add the "users who complimented you" as About.me does
* _Your idea hereâ€¦ ?_

Again, for any questions drop an email to [giuliano.iacobelli@stamplay.com](mailto:giuliano.iacobelli@stamplay.com) :)

Ciao!
